# SocialNetwork-Dotnet-React-Redux

This application mimiks facebook homepage. Telling you who's online and ho has posted, with authentication. If you type facebook or instagram in the post section will be replaced with `SuperDuperSocial`, this works as a middleware. Needs some improvement overall, maybe getting working the comments in post and likes in a future time, And improve the authentication. Overall works.

Feel free to critize the app any suggestion will be awsome. I like criticism always looking to improve my skill overall.

## Notes

This is a practical self learning experience. I made this for exploring new feutures to advance my knowledge with React/Redux and .NET and to teach the students in my university React and specificly .NET core, in Puerto Rico almost more than 65% of software jobs requires knowledge or experience with .NET Framework.

This is not for production or pre-production.
